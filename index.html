	  <p>Welcome to my website. My name is Dan Jones. I am a web developer and an actor, and I'd like to tell you a bit about myself.</p>

<h2>Dan Jones, the Web Developer</h2>

<div class="caption" id="attachment_68" align="alignright" width="300"><a href="http://danielrayjones.blogs.goodevilgenius.org/files/2013/02/C64c_system.jpg"><img src="http://danielrayjones.blogs.goodevilgenius.org/files/2013/02/C64c_system-300x240.jpg" alt="Commodore 64C" width="300" height="240" class="size-medium wp-image-68" /></a> Commodore 64C<br />&copy; <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C64c_system.jpg">Bill Bertram</a></div>

<p>I was first exposed to computers as a child. My family had a Commodore 64, on which, as a ten-year old child, I would
  do my homework, play games, and make simple programs. I learned how to program in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC"><abbr title="Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">
	  BASIC</abbr></a>. It was then that I began to
  understand how computers could improve our day-to-day lives.</p>

<p>When we upgraded to a newer computer, we finally got the Internet (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)">Prodigy</a>) in our home. When I was 14, I got my first email address, and at 15, created my first website on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">GeoCities</a> (my site was in the <em>Silicon Valley</em> "neighborhood"). My site was essentially a blog before blogs existed.</p>

<p>Initially, I built the site using a <abbr title=" What You See Is What You Get ">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor (namely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">MS FrontPage</a>), but with my programming background, I was interested in what made these pages into the pages I saw in my web browser. It wasn't long before I was hand-coding the site.</p>

<p>I learned <abbr title=" Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to layout the site, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets ">CSS</abbr> to give it some style, and eventually JavaScript to make it dynamic. During that time, I had my own web design business. I only had client while in high school, but I gained skills necessary to work with others and to take another person's vision, and make it real.</p>

<p>When I entered college, I gained additional skills necessary to run enterprise websites. I learned PHP, for truly dynamic website. I learned SQL, to interact with databases. I also gained some experience with server administration by setting up and running my website on my own <abbr title=" Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> server. I also gained experience with several platforms and frameworks.</p>

<p>Since that time, I've worked building websites for small businesses, educational organizations, and large media companies.</p>
